This is a _nice_ little test post.

## Code highlighting in R

```r
set.seed(12345)  # set RNG seed for reproducability
runExperiment <- function(obs) {
	experiment <- rbinom(obs,1,0.5)
	average = cumsum(experiment) / seq_along(experiment)
	df <- data.frame(x = 1:obs, y = average)
	print(
		ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) +
		geom_point() +
		ylim(0,1) + xlim(0,obs) + labs(x='', y='', title=paste('Obs:', obs, ' Average:', average[obs]))
	)
}
```
