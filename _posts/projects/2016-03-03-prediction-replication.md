Together with several co-authors, I study the reproducibility of experimental results in social science and how these can be predicted.

In Camerer et. al. (2016), we replicate 18 studies in experimental economics published in the American Economic Review and the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2011-2014. We follow a carefully designed procedure and find a significant effect in the right direction in 11 of the replications. See [the article](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/03/02/science.aaf0918) and [our website](http://experimentaleconreplications.com) for more information.

In one side project (Munafo et. al, 2015), we study how the outcome of the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) could be predicted in a market where the traders were faculty members at the participating departments. We show that prediction markets can be a useful tool to complement costly large-scale quality evaluations.

Currently, I am developing the methods we used in the papers above to study how to improve prediction of reproducibility. I use techniques from machine learning to explore which features are important for replication.
