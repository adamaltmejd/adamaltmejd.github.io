Good students tend to pick good schools. This selection mechanism makes it incredibly hard to estimate what effect education actually has. That graduates from some programs earn more could be because their skills improved more in school (a causal effect of education), but it could also be because they were more talented to start with (selection). In this research program I use statistical techniques to properly estimate the component that is causal.

To do so, I make use of archived applications to Swedish universities going back all the way to 1977. When there are more applicants than available spots, the system admits those with the highest scores. This creates natural experiments that I can exploit. For each program, some students end up above the cutoff and others end up below. Since the exact cutoffs changes from year to year, it is impossible to know beforehand if one will be admitted, and admission among those close to the cutoff can be considered random. Using data around the cutoff like an experiment is called a regression discontinuity design and is a powerful tool for causal identification. It is the backbone of all studies in this research program.

My work on this topic is supported by IFAU (152/2020), The Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation (W18-0005) and Forte (2016-07099).

## Family spill-overs

The first publication using this data is the paper "O Brother, Where Start Thou? Sibling Spillovers on College and Major Choice in Four Countries", published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics. It is an international collaboration where we study the causal effect of older sibling educational trajectories on younger sibling choices.

We study Chile, Croatia, Sweden, and the United States, and find individuals are more likely to apply to both the same college and the same college-major combination as their older siblings. The effect is similar in size across all four countries, despite the vast differences in education policy and institutions. In fact, Sweden and Chile are on opposite extremes of all OECD countries when it comes to average college earnings premia.

Interestingly we see younger siblings follow their older even when the alternative where they would go is seemingly worse than the counterfactual. However, we see no effect to alternatives from which the older sibling drops out.

Our findings underscore the importance of influence from close peers in life-changing decisions such as university education choice and could partly explain why inequalities in educational attainment between social groups persist.
