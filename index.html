    I do research in applied microeconomics, using extensive individual-level datasets to
    to study the causes and consequences of important real-life decisions, and how such choices are impacted by psychological biases, non-standard
    preferences, and the lack of information.
    My current work involves topics in
    <a href="/projects/college-choice/">college choice</a>, social preferences, and household finance. I am also coordinating a <a href="/projects/covid-19/">large research program about the covid-19 pandemic</a>.
