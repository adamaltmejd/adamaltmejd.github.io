In several different projects, we study how prediction markets can be used to ameliorate the scientific process. By eliciting private information, prediction markets allow us to study beliefs in replicability and quality of research. 

We have studied how well these markets can predict university rankings, and currently we are working on a market on scientific replicability in behavioral economics.

Joint work with several different researchers. A complete list of collaborators can be found on our [website](http://www.sciencepredictionmarkets.com).
