  <p>
    I'm <span itemprop="firstName">Adam</span>, a fifth-year
    <span itemprop="jobTitle">
    PhD Student</span> at the
    <span itemprop="worksFor" href="https://www.hhs.se/en/">Department of Economics
    at Stockholm School of Economics</span>,
    focusing on Behavioral Economics.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am interested in how our behavior affects society at large -
    the macroeconomic consequences of humanity's limited cognitive abilities.
    Among other things, I study the role of peer influence on decision making,
    even in high stakes settings, and research how people form biased beliefs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moreover, I strongly believe that social sciences need to become more
    open and accessible, which is why I am a <a itemprop="memberOf" href="http://www.bitss.org/people/adam-altmejd/">
    BITSS Catalyst</a> and partake in several replication efforts.
