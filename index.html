    I do research in empirical and experimental microeconomics,
    using econometric techniques to study how real-life decisions are impacted by psychological biases, non-standard
    preferences, and the lack of information.
    My current work involves topics such as
    <a href="/projects/college-choice/">college choice</a> and household finance.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe that social science research needs to become more
    open and reproducible, which is why I am a <a itemprop="memberOf" href="http://www.bitss.org/people/adam-altmejd/">
      BITSS Catalyst</a> and partake in several <a href="/projects/reproducibility/">replication
      projects</a>.
