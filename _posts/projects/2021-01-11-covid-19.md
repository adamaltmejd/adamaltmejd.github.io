The Covid-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted societies in ways we are only beginning to understand. I was part of the secretariat of [Coronakommissionen](http://coronakommissionen.com), the Swedish corona commission, tasked by the government to evaluate the Swedish response. The Commission released its [final report](https://coronakommissionen.com/publikationer/slutbetankande-sou-2022-10/) in February 2022, but together with Prof. Torsten Persson we have initiated a large, 4-year, research program to continue our studies of the topic. More information about the research program can be found [here](https://www.iies.su.se/about-us/faculty-news/register-data-will-increase-knowledge-about-the-pandemic-1.603390).

Since mid April 2020, I have published a graphical dashboard of the Swedish death count. The Public Health Agency of Sweden publishes statistics by actual date of death. Most other countries only report newly added deaths, without information about when each person died. Since it often takes some time for a death to be identified, this can be misleading. However, including death dates creates new problems. Mainly, the reporting delay means that the last few days are still not completed, which creates a false sense of an always decreasing trend. To account for this I added a graphical illustration of expected additional deaths. This later grew into a full-fledged nowcasting model documented in the paper below.
