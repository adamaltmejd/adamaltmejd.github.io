  I'm <span itemprop="firstName">Adam</span>, a fifth-year
  <span itemprop="jobTitle"><a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/Research/Departments/DE/people/faculty-and-staff---de/?personId=31031033">
  PhD Student</a></span> at the
  <a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/Research/Departments/DE/">Department of Economics</a>
  at <a itemprop="affiliation" href="https://www.hhs.se/en/">Stockholm School of Economics</a>,
  focusing on Behavioral Economics using both empirical and experimental data.
  Last year, I visited the <a href="http://economics.harvard.edu">Department of
  Economics at Harvard University</a>, invited by Professor David Laibson.
</p>

<p>
  I am interested in how our behavior affects society at large -
  the macroeconomic consequences of humanity's limited cognitive abilities.
  Among other things, I study the role of peer influence on decision making,
  even in high stakes settings, and research how people form biased beliefs.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, I strongly believe that social sciences need to become more
  open and accessible, which is why I am a <a href="http://www.bitss.org/people/adam-altmejd/">
  BITSS Catalyst</a> and partake in several
  <a href="https://adamaltmejd.se/projects/scientific-reproducibility-and-its-predictability/">replication efforts</a>.
