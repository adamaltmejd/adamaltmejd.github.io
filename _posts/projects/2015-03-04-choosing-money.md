Valuation of fiat money is universal today. Choosing to hold intrinsically worthless cash is a convention that can be understood as one among many equilibria of some coordination game. Recent macroeconomic frameworks aimed at modelling this behavior do generate monetary economies, but are unable to provide any criteria for equilibrium selection. Hence, while agents can choose money, it is ambiguous if they will.

We seek to provide an explanation to the universality of money by experimentally evaluating how and why fiat money can be valued as an equilibrium selection process. We do this by implementing a version of the Hugget (1993) economy, proposed by Krusell, Mukoyama and Smith (2011) in the lab, and treat subjects in key dimensions.
