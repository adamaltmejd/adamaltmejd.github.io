Recently, theories of games with Knightian uncertainty, or ambiguity have been developed. Assuming neo-additive capacities and using the Chateauneuf et. al. (2007) model, we explore evolutionary stability of ambiguity-contingent preferences in different types of games. Could optimistic agents have an persistent and stable advantage in certain settings? Joint work with [Thomas Seiler](http://www.hhs.se/en/person/?personid=34461033).
