    I do research on inequality, education, and health, in applied microeconomics, using extensive individual-level datasets to
    to study the causes and consequences of important real-life decisions. My current work involves topics in
    <a href="/projects/college-choice/">college choice</a>, social preferences, and household finance. I am also coordinating SWECOV, a <a href="/projects/covid-19/">large research program about the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.
