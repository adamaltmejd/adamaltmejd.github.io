      I am a <span itemprop="jobTitle">Post-doc</span> at the
      <a href="https://www.sofi.su.se" itemprop="worksFor">Institute for Social Research (SOFI)</a>
      as well as the <a href="https://www.houseoffinance.se" itemprop="worksFor">Swedish House of Finance</a>.
      I received my Ph.D. from <a href="https://www.hhs.se" itemprop="">Stockholm School of Economics</a> in 2018.

      I do research in empirical and experimental microeconomics,
      using econometric techniques to study how real-life decisions are impacted
      by psychological biases, information asymmetries, and non-standard preferences.
      My current projects focus on the realm of
      <a href="/projects/college-choice/">education choices</a> and financial
      decisions.

      I am interested in how our behavior affects society at large -
      the macroeconomic consequences of humanity's limited cognitive abilities.
      Among other things, I study the role of peer influence on decision making,
      even in high stakes settings, and research how people form biased beliefs.

      I strongly believe that social science research needs to become more
      open and reproducible, which is why I am a <a itemprop="memberOf" href="http://www.bitss.org/people/adam-altmejd/">
      BITSS Catalyst</a> and partake in several <a href="/projects/scientific-reproducibility-and-its-predictability/">replication efforts</a>.
