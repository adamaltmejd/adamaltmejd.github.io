The Covid-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted societies in ways we are only beginning to understand. I was part of the secretariat of [Coronakommissionen](http://coronakommissionen.com), the Swedish corona commission, tasked by the government to evaluate the Swedish response. The Commission released its [final report](https://coronakommissionen.com/publikationer/slutbetankande-sou-2022-10/) in February 2022, but together with Prof. Torsten Persson and Olof Ã–stergren, I have initiated a large, 4-year, research program to continue our studies of the topic. More information about the Swedish Register-based Research Program on COVID-19 can be found on [swecov.se](https://swecov.se).

## COVID-19 Dashboard
Since mid April 2020, I have published a popular graphical dashboard of the Swedish death count. The Public Health Agency of Sweden publishes statistics by actual date of death. Most other countries only report newly added deaths, without information about when each person died. Since it often takes time for a death to be identified, this can be misleading. However, reporting death by death dates creates new problems. Mainly, the reporting delay means that recent days are not completed, which creates an illusion an always decreasing trend. To account for this, I added a graphical illustration of expected additional deaths. This later grew into a full-fledged nowcasting model documented in the paper below.
