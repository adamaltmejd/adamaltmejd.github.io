In several different projects, we study how prediction markets can be used to ameliorate the scientific process. By eliciting private information, prediction markets allow us to study beliefs in replicability and quality of research. Currently working on a market on replicability in behavioral economics. Joint with, [Magnus Johannesson](http://www.hhs.se/en/person/?PersonID=1981033) and [Anna Dreber Almenberg](http://www.hhs.se/en/person/?PersonID=12741033) among others (a complete list of contributors is available [online](http://www.sciencepredictionmarkets.com)).
