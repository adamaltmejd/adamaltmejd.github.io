  <p>
    I am a <span itemprop="jobTitle">Post-doc</span> at the
    <a href="https://www.sofi.su.se" itemprop="worksFor">Institute for Social Research</a> (SOFI)
    and at the <a href="https://www.houseoffinance.se" itemprop="worksFor">Swedish House of Finance</a>.
    I received my Ph.D. from <a href="https://www.hhs.se" itemprop="">Stockholm School of Economics</a> in 2018.

  <p>
    I do research in empirical and experimental microeconomics,
    using econometric techniques to study how real-life decisions are impacted
    by psychological biases, non-standard preferences, and lack of information.
    My current projects focus on the realm of
    <a href="/projects/college-choice/">education choices</a> and financial
    decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I strongly believe that social science research needs to become more
    open and reproducible, which is why I am a <a itemprop="memberOf" href="http://www.bitss.org/people/adam-altmejd/">
    BITSS Catalyst</a> and partake in several <a href="/projects/reproducibility/">replication efforts</a>.
