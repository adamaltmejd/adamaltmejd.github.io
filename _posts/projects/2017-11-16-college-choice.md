During my Ph.D. studies, I created a unique data set of over 40 years of individual applications to Swedish universities. Since then, I have been working on a number of papers using this data and exploiting regression discontinuity designs to study the causal effect of university education on a number of different outcomes.

My work on this topic is supported by IFAU (152/2020), The Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation (W18-0005) and Forte (2016-07099).

## Sibling spill-overs

The first publication using this data is the paper "O Brother, Where Start Thou? Sibling Spillovers on College and Major Choice in Four Countries", published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics. It is an international collaboration where we study the causal effect of older sibling educational trajectories on younger sibling choices.

We study Chile, Croatia, Sweden, and the United States, and find individuals are more likely to apply to both the same college and the same college-major combination as their older siblings. The effect is similar in size across all four countries, despite the vast differences in education policy and institutions. In fact, Sweden and Chile are on opposite extremes of all OECD countries when it comes to average college earnings premia.

Interestingly we see younger siblings follow their older even when the alternative where they would go is seemingly worse than the counterfactual. However, we see no effect to alternatives from which the older sibling drops out.

Our findings underscore the importance of influence from close peers in life-changing decisions such as university education choice and could partly explain why inequalities in educational attainment between social groups persist.
